## The main reasons to use coconut oil in the diet:

1. Saturated fat is necessary for good health.
2. Polyunsaturated fats are risky.
3. Clean calorie source.
4. Makes food taste better.

## Saturated fat is necessary for good health

This may seem like a crazy statement, given the advice since the mid to late 1900's. Saturated fat was deemed the cause of heart disease, clogged arteries, and high cholesterol.

### The link between saturate fat and heart disease

The [American Heart Association](http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/HealthyLiving/HealthyEating/Nutrition/Saturated-Fats_UCM_301110_Article.jsp) still recommends avoiding saturated fats by replacing them with "liquid" oils to avoid hydrogenated fats (aka trans fats). Interestingly, they say their advice is based on a review of scientific studies, but they don't cite any.

While the American Heart Association maintains their position against saturated fats, [WebMD](http://www.webmd.com/heart-disease/news/20140320/dietary-fats-q-a) says that the link between saturated fat and heart disease doesn't exist.
